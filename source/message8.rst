Image

This image was produced from the eighth radio transmission using :doc:`previously contributed code <radio-transmission-recording>`.

This annotated version of the image was made using :ref:`code from message #3 <message3-code>`.

Interpretation
--------------

Appears to designate a syntax for declaring variables.

Variables have a border of high values framing a negative of numbers as previously encoded in message #1.


Decoded
-------

.. literalinclude:: message8-decoded.txt


Code
----

.. todo::

   Revise the :ref:`Haskell code <message3-code>` to support new glyphs from the eighth message. (appears to be done by @pink_snow but has not yet been updated in a PR)
